# optiver-trading-at-the-close
This repo contains my submission for the Kaggle competition, [Optiver - Trading at the Close](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/optiver-trading-at-the-close/overview). The goal is to predict closing price movements for 200 Nasdaq stocks using historical auction data.

Although my leaderboard rank is humbling (~3300/4400+), I got to dabble with ensemble learning and neural net architectures, which made this an ideal follow-up to [`fintech-bootcamp-at-home`](https://github.com/whitgroves/fintech-bootcamp-at-home).
